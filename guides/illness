# Triv’s Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease Survival Guide

## Summary of Ilnesses
*This is based on personal experience and research, some data might be outdated or incorrect*

	Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are very similar illnesses, the main difference is one attacks the large intestine and the other the small intestine. The method of attack is through immune responses in the immune receptor channels within the intestines. They don’t know exactly what causes it: a genetic mutation,  a foreign virus/bacteria that hides well, or possibly a mixture of the two. My GI says the latest information is pointing to it being some strange hard to detect foreign invader(bacteria, viral, fungal, or something new) that’s potentially taking advantage of a genetic  mutation.
	Either way what happens is the body has a flagging system for immune responses, we have these cells called B-Cells that have a bunch of variants that are used for signifying to the body what type of response to give. Whenever we have this illness it tricks our bodies into sending out the wrong immune system response. It flags healthy areas of the intestines as bacteria/foreign instead of the other localized bacteria within the intestines. 
	A theory is the bacteria are either creating the circumstances that lead to this mutation or causing it themselves. Because they don’t only redirect the flagging system to destroy healthy tissue, they also use it to create defensive layers around themselves. This is in the forms of tissue layers that feel like cysts. Don’t think this happens in the intestines as much but this part happened a little when I had active crohn’s disease but picked up a lot when I went fulltime on Humira(very similar to Entyvio just different company).
	 **Vitamin D 5000 IU**- take this everyday it is a life saver. Can literally feel a difference after taking it everyday for a week. It helps normalize and regulate the immune system. My GI yells at any of his patients that are not taking Vitamin D because people with this illness don’t produce enough generally and need to supplement to make up for it. He also mentioned that there is direct correlation between vitamin D levels and reduction of symptoms, I didn’t research this so can’t confirm, but it feels that way.

## Effected Systems

### Skin
	**Symptoms**: Acne, Cystic Acne, Erythema Nodosum or similar skin bacterial infections. 
	**Summary**:  Unfortunately one of the downsides to this illness, is even after it gets fixed in the colon from the treatments it still attacks other parts of the body, as for my case with higher severity after the colon is in remission. My best guess is this is related to the bacteria in your body inducing the defensive parts of the immune system. Hence why cystic acne is made instead of a simple pimple over one piece of dirt.
	**Strategy**: This one is a pain in the ass to deal with because it’s hard to keep bacteria off your body, and on top of that some bacteria is necessary. The techniques I’ve found work the best are dieting and tracking your hands. Tracking your hands means, don’t touch your face unless you absolutely have to, and if you do try to use a clean rag. Our hands collect so much bacteria from the environment, without cleaning them first it causes issues. Try to apply this concept all the time, if I go out in public I won’t touch my face at all unless I wash my hands first or I wait until getting home. This will also reduce sickness over all. Used to get sick all the time while working in the hospital started a strict hand-washing and no face touching policy, haven’t gotten sick really since. That was 4-5 years ago.
	**Diet**: Certain foods feed bacteria more than others. They primarily like Lactose, Sugars, and other high fructose foods that are generally termed unhealthy. Candies, dairy products, high sugar baked goods, and etc. Tested this several times during my life, it’s hard to do but the longest time I was skin-issue  free was when I went no lactose/candy for 3 months. 
	**Prescribed Medication**: SSKI (potassium iodide solution)- this is a high powered vitamin iodide mixture that my GI says can only be done once every 3 months. For some people it works really well. First time I did it my acne/skin issues got worse for a week, but after that it dramatically reduced over the next month. Only downside for me atleast, is I think my body built up a resistance to it because after using it for 2 years, it’s not nearly as effective. Taking a break for 2 years then going to try it again.

### Mouth
	**Symptoms**: Mouth ulcers, cuts, and sometimes gum infections.
	**Summary**: This one sucks, didn’t really know about it until after I went into remission. Wasn’t an issue prior, not sure why it starts happening in remission. What happens is little cuts or scrapes from rough food can make little openings for bacteria to get into the gums. This causes little ulcerations along the gums, which are painful but not too bad. It scared me a few times, went to the dentist thinking that I somehow got gingivitis. Only to find out is the illness taking it’s toll again.
	**Diet**: Bacteria grows in your mouth no matter what, not much that I know of diet wise that can help here.
	**Strategy**: Regular dental hygiene, don’t overdo it. Too much dental hygiene(flossing, and brushing) can cause damage to the mouth. That causes openings the bacteria can take to take advantage of. The best practice I’ve found is do normal dental hygiene like everyone else, but after you floss use mouthwash. Listerine to be exact, or something that has the same components in it. Listerine uses all natural essential oils that can be used everyday without issue and they are the most effective mouthwash IMO.
	
### Body
	**Symptoms**: Joint pains, easily dislocated joints, tension head-aches, muscle pain, hyper-mobility and other posture related issues.
	**Summary**: This one is more of an indirect side-effect of the illness. One factor is the part where we use different positioning/posture with our bodies to try and mitigate the abdomen pain. Over time this causes posture issues. Another is how Humira(Entyvio) and other medications work, they module the white blood cell systems of the body. There are giant white blood cell clusters/nodes around most joints, so when the medication is working sometimes those can swell or get smaller than normal. This leads to joint pain, posture issues, head-aches and etc.
	**Diet**: Haven’t found a lot that works here except maybe increasing protein intake to help with the strategy section.
	**Strategy**: Stretching, exercise, and braces for joints that are hurting: ankle, knee, back/shoulder. This part sucks because failing to do enough stretching or exercise can lead to tension head-aches that are like migraines that last anywhere from 2-8 hours. Usually those head-aches incapacitate me, it’s like an unending loop of pain that keeps waving over me until I either exercise enough that something pops back into place or puke so much I pass out. If you get headaches as well let me know, I have created some natural over the counter strategies that work well with prevention and treatment.

### Intestines/Stomach
	**Symptoms**: Gastric reflux, vomiting, cramping, pain, burning, and etc.
	**Summary**: Already described above what I think is happening here. 
	**Diet**: 
		*Foods To Avoid*: Dairy-based, high sugar, high fructose, any spinach(the enzyme in it breaks down the medication in the intestines), gluten products can cause issues as well for some people.
	**Strategy**: This one is tough to deal with because all we can do is take the medications, and hope they work. There are a few techniques I have found that helped mitigate the pain. Breathing exercises, these help calm down the body and de-stress it. Since our intestines have a neural link to our brain(why GI illnesses have heavy link to mental illness), de-stress and reducing anxiety can decrease the tension in the intestines. Other meditation practices work well since they all have do deal with lowering heart-rate, blood-pressure, oxygen levels and basically relaxing the body. 
	If having more stomach issues than intestinal issues, dieting might be more of a factor. Would look into what diets cause the least amount of strain on the stomach. Dieting is huge in this illness, pay attention to what you eat. We are all different, so we have to map it out with trial and error.
